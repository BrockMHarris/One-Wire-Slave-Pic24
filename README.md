# One-Wire-Slave-Pic24
One-wire slave code for pic24h that emulates the ds18b20 temperature sensor

Special thanks to Bartek Fabiszewski for making the slave code for the PIC16, and to Lam Ngo for porting this code to the Pic24. We have improved the original code through more accurate timing, functionality for writing to the slave, and other bug fixes.

slave code for pic24hj128gp502 only one C file can be run at once. The original Slave file was written by Lam Ngo
and edited by Brock Harris.
As far as I can tell Lam's orginal code does not work as inteded so i am trying to change it so it works
Do not edit the orginal file.

pic_slave: This is the most up to dat file. All changes here should be operational

pic_slave_backup: This is Lam Ngo's code, but with more comments as i understand it so that it is easier to read

pic_slave_original: This is the origianl code that was written by Lam Ngo, DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE

pic_slave_test: This is the testing file so that i can test small changes to Lam's code

pic_1_slave_working: This is the code that works when only the pic is connected to the bus (use pic_2_slave_working 
	if possible)

pic_2_slaves_working: This is the code that works when the pic is connected to the bus with multiple
	other one wire buses. (This does not work with multiple pics)

pic_2_pics_working: Previously i was haveing toruble getting multiple pics to work together. But they work now

pic_slave_write_working: You can now write values to the slave
